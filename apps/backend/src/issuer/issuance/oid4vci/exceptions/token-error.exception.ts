 * - `invalid_grant`:
 *   - The Authorization Server expects a Transaction Code in the Pre-Authorized Code Flow but the Client provides the wrong Transaction Code.
 *   - The End-User provides the wrong Pre-Authorized Code or the Pre-Authorized Code has expired.
 * - `invalid_client`:
 *   - The Client tried to send a Token Request with a Pre-Authorized Code without a Client ID but the Authorization Server does not support anonymous access.

/**
 * Exception for OAuth 2.0 Token Error responses.
 *
 * According to RFC 6749 Section 5.2 and OID4VCI Section 6.3, the response
 * MUST use HTTP status code 400 and contain `error` and optionally `error_description`.
 *
 * Error codes from RFC 6749:
 * - `invalid_request`: The request is missing a required parameter, includes an
 *   unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter,
 *   includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for
 *   authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed.
 * - `invalid_client`: Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no
 *   client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method).
 * - `invalid_grant`: The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization
 *   code, resource owner credentials) or refresh token is invalid, expired,
 *   revoked, does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization
 *   request, or was issued to another client.
 * - `unauthorized_client`: The authenticated client is not authorized to use
 *   this authorization grant type.
 * - `unsupported_grant_type`: The authorization grant type is not supported
 *   by the authorization server.
 * - `invalid_scope`: The requested scope is invalid, unknown, malformed, or
 *   exceeds the scope granted by the resource owner.
