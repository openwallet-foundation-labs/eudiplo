# Testing

EUDIPLO is designed to be robust and easy to test both in development and CI
environments. This guide outlines how to run, write, and automate tests for the
project.

---

## Running Tests Locally

To run all unit and integration tests locally:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

Or with watch mode:

```bash
pnpm run test:watch
```

This uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) under the hood, which is configured for
NestJS.

---

## Test Coverage

To check code coverage:

```bash
pnpm run test:cov
```

This generates a report in the `/coverage` folder. Open `coverage/index.html` in
your browser to view it.

---

## Test Structure

Tests are located next to their implementation files:

```
src/
  service/
    my.service.ts
    my.service.spec.ts  <-- Test file
```

Use `.spec.ts` naming to ensure Vitest picks up the test files automatically.

---

## Linting

Before pushing code, check linting rules and fix them:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

---

## GitHub Actions

Tests run automatically on every push to `main` or pull request via GitHub
Actions.

You can find the workflow config in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Keep unit tests isolated; mock dependencies using tools like `vitest.mock()`
  or NestJS's testing module.
- For HTTP integration tests, use
  [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).
- For mocking external APIs (e.g., Vault or Keycloak), consider
  [`nock`](https://github.com/nock/nock).

Happy testing! ðŸš€
