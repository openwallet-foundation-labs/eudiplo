# Web Client

EUDIPLO provides a user-friendly web interface for credential management‚Äîno API expertise required. Simply enter your instance URL and credentials to get started. There's no need to deploy a separate client for each instance.

There is no need to use the client to interact with EUDIPLO, but it offers a more intuitive way to manage the configurations.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Web Client

After completing the [Full Setup](./quick-start.md#step-1-choose-your-setup):

1. **Open your browser** and go to: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
2. **Login** using the default credentials:
   - **Username:** `root`
   - **Password:** `root`

> **Important:** Change the default credentials before using EUDIPLO in production. See [Authentication](../api/authentication.md) for details.

## Configuration Editing & Validation

The web client is designed for intuitive and robust configuration management:

- **Data Model & Validation:** The EUDIPLO service uses decorators on data transfer objects (DTOs) and entities to describe variables and their values, enabling server-side validation.
- **OpenAPI Specification:** An OpenAPI spec is generated from these DTOs and entities, providing a standardized interface for backend interaction.
- **SDK Integration:** The web client uses an SDK generated from the OpenAPI spec for seamless and type-safe communication with the backend.
- **Editing Experience:**
  
    - Simple variables (strings, numbers, booleans) are edited via text inputs, select options, or checkboxes.
    - Complex data structures are managed using an integrated JSON editor (Monaco Editor), which leverages JSON schemas for each variable.
  
- **Client-Side Validation & Guidance:** The JSON editor uses the provided JSON schemas to offer inline descriptions, auto-completion, and validation directly in the browser.
- **Direct JSON Access:** Each configuration can be viewed and edited as raw JSON for advanced use cases.
