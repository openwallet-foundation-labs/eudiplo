# Wallet Compatibility

EUDIPLO is designed to work with **EUDI-compliant wallets** that implement the
supported protocols
([OID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html),
[OID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html),
and
[SD-JWT VC](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-08.html)).

This page provides information about tested wallets, compatibility status, and
guidance for testing new wallets with EUDIPLO.

## Compatibility Requirements

For a wallet to be compatible with EUDIPLO, it must support:

### **Issuance Flow (OID4VCI)**

- ‚úÖ Authorization Code Flow
- ‚úÖ Pre-authorized Code Flow
- ‚úÖ SD-JWT VC format
- ‚úÖ Proof of possession (DPoP or client attestation)

### **Presentation Flow (OID4VP)**

- ‚úÖ Authorization Request via deep link or QR code
- ‚úÖ VP Token submission
- ‚úÖ Selective disclosure of SD-JWT VC claims
- ‚úÖ Response mode `direct_post`

### **General Requirements**

- ‚úÖ HTTPS endpoints support
- ‚úÖ JSON Web Token (JWT) handling
- ‚úÖ Cryptographic key management (ES256, EdDSA)

---

## Known Compatibility Issues

### **Common Issues**

- **Deep Link Handling**: Some wallets may have different URL scheme
  requirements
- **Certificate Validation**: Strict certificate chain validation may require
  proper CA setup
- **Timeout Handling**: Different wallets may have varying timeout expectations

### **Workarounds**

Most compatibility issues can be resolved through:

- Proper SSL certificate configuration
- Adjusting timeout values in EUDIPLO configuration
- Using appropriate redirect URIs for the wallet's URL scheme

## Testing New Wallets

If you want to test EUDIPLO with a new wallet, follow these steps:

### **1. Setup Test Environment**

```bash
# Run EUDIPLO with proper HTTPS endpoint
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain.com \
  -e JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-minimum-32-characters \
  ghcr.io/openwallet-foundation-labs/eudiplo:latest
```

### **2. Test Credential Issuance**

1. Configure a test credential template
2. Initiate issuance flow via API
3. Complete the flow in your wallet
4. Verify credential is stored correctly

### **3. Test Credential Presentation**

1. Create a presentation request
2. Generate QR code or deep link
3. Present credential from wallet
4. Verify presentation is received and validated

### **4. Document Results**

Please document:

- Wallet name and version
- Test results (success/failure)
- Any configuration adjustments needed
- Error messages or issues encountered
