# Wallet Compatibility

EUDIPLO is designed to work with **EUDI-compliant wallets** that implement the
supported protocols
([OID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html),
[OID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html),
and
[SD-JWT VC](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-08.html)).

This page provides information about tested wallets, compatibility status, and
guidance for testing new wallets with EUDIPLO.
