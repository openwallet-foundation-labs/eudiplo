# Interactive Authorization Endpoint (IAE)

The **Interactive Authorization Endpoint (IAE)** enables user interactions during the credential issuance flow. It allows wallets to request user authorization through a sequence of configurable actions before credential issuance completes.

This is particularly useful for:

- **Identity verification** – Request a verifiable presentation from the wallet (e.g., PID, mDL)
- **Web-based flows** – Redirect users to complete forms, payments, or external verification
- **Multi-step authorization** – Combine multiple actions in sequence (e.g., present ID, then complete KYC form)

---

## How It Works

The IAE is part of the OID4VCI authorization code flow. When a wallet initiates issuance with `interaction_types_supported`, EUDIPLO responds with the first required action. The wallet must complete each action in sequence before receiving an authorization code.

    actor Wallet as EUDI Wallet
    participant EUDIPLO as Middleware
    participant Service as Your Backend

    Wallet->>EUDIPLO: Authorization Request<br/>(interaction_types_supported)
    EUDIPLO-->>Wallet: IAE Response (Step 1: openid4vp)

    Wallet->>EUDIPLO: OpenID4VP Presentation
    EUDIPLO-->>Wallet: IAE Response (Step 2: redirect_to_web)

    Wallet->>Service: User completes web form
    Service->>EUDIPLO: Callback with code_verifier
    EUDIPLO-->>Wallet: Authorization Code

    Wallet->>EUDIPLO: Token Request
    EUDIPLO-->>Wallet: Access Token

    Wallet->>EUDIPLO: Credential Request
    EUDIPLO-->>Wallet: Credential
```

## Supported Action Types

IAE supports the following action types, which can be combined in any order:

| Action Type              | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openid4vp_presentation` | Request a verifiable presentation from the wallet using OpenID4VP           |
| `redirect_to_web`        | Redirect the user to a web page for additional interaction (forms, payment) |

---

## Configuring IAE Actions

IAE actions are configured per credential configuration. You can define a sequence of actions that must be completed before credential issuance.

### Example: Single Presentation

Request a PID presentation before issuing a credential:

```json
{
    "credentialConfigId": "citizen-credential",
    "iaeActions": [
        {
            "type": "openid4vp_presentation",
            "label": "Identity Verification",
            "presentationConfigId": "pid-presentation-config"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example: Multi-Step Flow

First verify identity with a presentation, then redirect to a web form:

```json
{
    "credentialConfigId": "organization-credential",
    "iaeActions": [
        {
            "type": "openid4vp_presentation",
            "label": "Identity Verification",
            "presentationConfigId": "pid-presentation-config"
        },
        {
            "type": "redirect_to_web",
            "label": "Complete Registration",
            "url": "https://example.com/register?session={auth_session}",
            "description": "Please complete the organization registration form"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Action Types Reference

### OpenID4VP Presentation

Requests a verifiable presentation from the wallet.

| Field                  | Type   | Required | Description                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `type`                 | string | Yes      | Must be `"openid4vp_presentation"`          |
| `label`                | string | No       | Display label for this step                 |
| `presentationConfigId` | string | Yes      | ID of the presentation configuration to use |

The presentation configuration defines which credentials and claims to request. See [Presentation Configuration](./presentations.md) for details.

### Redirect to Web

Redirects the user to a web page for additional interaction.

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description                                                         |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`        | string | Yes      | Must be `"redirect_to_web"`                                         |
| `label`       | string | No       | Display label for this step                                         |
| `url`         | string | Yes      | URL to redirect the user to (supports `{auth_session}` placeholder) |
| `callbackUrl` | string | No       | URL for the external service to redirect back to                    |
| `description` | string | No       | Instructions for the user (displayed in wallet)                     |

The `{auth_session}` placeholder in the URL is replaced with the session identifier, allowing your backend to correlate the web interaction with the issuance flow.

---

## Completing Web-Based Actions

When using `redirect_to_web`, your backend must signal completion by calling back to EUDIPLO with a `code_verifier`:

```bash
POST /{tenantId}/oid4vci/authorize/interactive
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "auth_session": "<session-id>",
    "code_verifier": "<unique-verifier>"
}
```

EUDIPLO will verify the `code_verifier` and either:

- Return the next action (if more steps remain), or
- Issue the authorization code (if all steps are complete)

---

## Session State

During the IAE flow, EUDIPLO tracks:

| Field                | Description                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `currentStepIndex`   | Index of the current action (0-based)   |
| `completedStepsData` | Data collected from each completed step |
| `iaeActions`         | The configured action sequence          |

This state is managed automatically. Your backend only needs to respond to the configured actions.

---

## Claims Webhook Integration

When an `openid4vp_presentation` action is completed, EUDIPLO can call a **claims webhook** to transform the verified presentation data into credential claims.

See [Webhooks](./webhooks.md#claims-webhook) for configuration details.

---

## Fallback Behavior

If no `iaeActions` are configured for a credential, EUDIPLO falls back to the wallet's `interaction_types_supported` preference:

1. If the wallet supports `openid4vp` and a presentation configuration exists → use OpenID4VP
2. If the wallet supports `redirect_to_web` → use web redirect
3. Otherwise → return an error

This ensures backward compatibility with wallets that don't support multi-step flows.

---

## Error Handling

IAE errors are returned as JSON:

```json
{
    "error": "invalid_request",
    "error_description": "Missing required field: code_verifier"
}
```

Common errors:

| Error Code              | Description                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `invalid_request`       | Missing required parameters                  |
| `invalid_auth_session`  | Session not found or expired                 |
| `invalid_code_verifier` | Code verifier mismatch for web authorization |
| `presentation_failed`   | OpenID4VP presentation verification failed   |
