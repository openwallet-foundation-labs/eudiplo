Integration\nEUDIPLO is an open-source middleware that bridges your backend and EUDI Wallets\nusing a unified API and standardized protocols.\n\n🧭 Overview\nOrganizations joining the EUDI Wallet ecosystem face a tough choice: patch\ntogether protocol libraries that may not exist for their stack, or rely on\nproprietary solutions that risk vendor lock-in.\nEUDIPLO solves this by providing a lightweight, source-available, protocol\nabstraction layer. It communicates over HTTP and integrates easily with your\nexisting backend stack—so you can focus on your business logic, not\ncryptographic plumbing.\nIt supports all core flows of electronic attribute attestations—issuing,\nrequesting, and even requesting during issuance—and is already\ncompatible with multiple\nwallets.\nWhile still in early development, EUDIPLO is built for production: secure key\nmanagement, scalable database support, and clean API boundaries.\n\n🧩 Features\n\n✅ Supports OID4VCI, OID4VP, SD-JWT VC, and OAuth Token Status\nList\n✅ JSON-based credential configuration\n✅ Client credentials authentication for easy service integration\n✅ Runs via Docker with .env config\n✅ HTTP-based integration with any backend\n✅ Secure key management & pluggable storage\n✅ Privacy-friendly: no external calls, no long-term storage\n\n\n🚀 Quick Start\nExample :# Clone and configure\ngit clone https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/eudiplo.git\ncd eudiplo\ncp .env.example .env\n\n# Configure authentication\necho \"JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)\" >> .env\necho \"AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 24)\" >> .env\n\n# Start with Docker\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -e PUBLIC_URL=https://example.com \\\n  -e JWT_SECRET=your-32-character-secret \\\n  -e AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-issuer-secret \\\n  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \\\n  ghcr.io/openwallet-foundation-labs/eudiplo:latest\n\n# Get a token and start using the API\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:3000/oauth2/token \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"client_id\": \"root\",\n    \"client_secret\": \"root\"\n  }'📚 API:\nhttps://openwallet-foundation-labs.github.io/eudiplo/latest/api/📦\nFull setup:\nQuickstart Guide\n\n📚 Documentation\nChoose your documentation version:\n\n🚀 Latest Stable (recommended):\nhttps://openwallet-foundation-labs.github.io/eudiplo/latest/ -\nDocumentation for the most recent major release\n🔬 Development:\nhttps://openwallet-foundation-labs.github.io/eudiplo/main/ -\nLatest features from the main branch\n📚 Specific Major Versions:\nv1,\nv2, etc.\n\nKey sections:\n\nArchitecture\nSupported Protocols\nAPI Reference\nCode Documentation\n\n\n🤝 Contributing\nWe welcome PRs from wallet developers, institutions, and contributors interested\nin advancing the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.\nSee CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.\n💬 Have questions?
